😊 I am **Oskar**, better known as **rxsto** and **oz**! I am currently working on various projects including [Groovy](https://groovy.bot), [Hydra](https://hydra.bot) and [Dalacy](https://dalacy.net). Most of my contributions are **private** as of now but I still try to focus on committing myself to **open-source** libraries and projects.

🚀 My journey in the wonderful land of code started at **age 11** when I first tried creating **simple websites** - this is possibly the reason why my **main skillset** is based on creating **web applications**.

🎓 I've **continued** making websites over the years now but I'd still call myself an experienced **full stack** / **devops** engineer since I started working on **backend applications** more and more.

👷🏻 I am a huge fan of **using state-of-the-art systems** for deploying applications - and I'd also call myself **experienced** at working with **Kubernetes**. All of my **current active** projects are running in that container-orchestration system.

👀 If you're **further interested** in my person and my work you can have a deeper look at [rxs.to](https://rxs.to) - my personal website.

🌞 Have a **great day**! Cheers ~ rxsto
